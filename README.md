# deerhunter


For my final project of the Per Scholas program, a created a static site for my favorite rock band the Deerhunter. Six weeks of CSS, HTML, and Vanilla JS training culminating into a solid beginner dev project.  This website got me into General Assembly.  Perhaps the design is a bit busy, and the copy is all from wikipedia.....but this was my first swing at developing a front-end-only page.  Enjoy!

Deployed online at delirious-boats.surge.sh !
